        'Werewolf! takes place in a chat room where users play the role of villagers investigating a series of crimes. They donâ€™t know who the murderer is, but they do know that he/she passes off as a villager during the day. This has led them to adopt the practice of casting out one villager per day in hopes of casting out the murderer.',
